I started to develop DbGate at the end of 2019. Main reason was, that I switched from Windows to Linux, where it was quite hard to find any usable database tool. 

# DbGate goals
* Complete free and open source, no paid enterprise editions
* Simple, but powerful. One toolbar, no milions of icons without description. Heavy use of context menu
* Should runs everywhere - Windows, Linux, Mac, web browser, maybe also mobile web in future
* Stable and robust. Critical error in one database driver must not influence stability of app
* Scriptable, using dbgate [nodejs packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dbgate-api)

# About author
My name is Jan Prochazka, I live in Czech Republic. I was specialized to realtime computation software, which used heavy Miccrosoft SQL Server. Now I work mainly with JavaScript and modern techology stack around it.

# Wrote about us
You can see, what wrote about DbGate [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Servers/Database-Utils/DbGate.shtml) software catalog portal

# DbGate technology stack
* DbGate frontend is build with excellent [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework. Formerly is was build with React
* Backend uses node.js
* Application uses electron
* Web version is distributed as docker container

# Sources of inspiration
I am playing with creating database management quite a long time. This software inspired me at most:
* Visual Studio Code - great IDE, simple but powerful
* DatAdmin, DbMouse - DB management tools, which I created in past
* Beekeeper Studio - simple but nice SQL client written in nodejs/electron
* Navicat - and its color scheme in table data browser, which I am using over 10 years
