I started to develop DbGate at the beginning of 2020. Main reason was, that I switched from Windows to Linux, where it was quite hard to find any usable database tool. Before I have created database tools DatAdmin and DbMouse, which were commercial products. DbGate takes the best from them, and offers it under opensource MIT license.
