I am glad to announce new release a partnership between me (Jan Prochazka, DbGate developer) and [Sprinx Systems](https://sprinx.com/en/) company. Sprinx is czech software company, focused on custom development, e-commerce and bussiness systems with 28 years of experiences with IT systems. 

We decided to create new product from DbGate, DbGate PRO, with commercial license and paid support. Also we are commited to support opensource world, so current DbGate will remain as free and opensource product (newly under GPL license).

What DbGate PRO will offer?
DbGate PRO will be offered primarily as web version, to be installed as docker container. The first release is planned to September 2024.
* All from DbGate FREE
* Email support
* Administration console
  * User management
  * Connection management
  * OAuth and LDAP configuration
  * Role base permission system
* Azure SQL support
* Cosmos DB support


What DbGate FREE will offer?
There are no plans to make any limitations of current desktop version. Because DbGate FREE and PRO shares the same codebase, DbGate FREE will profit from fixes and improvements made for its paid brother.
Web version for FREE edition will support only logins declared in ENV variables (OAuth and LDAP protocols will be supported only in PRO version).
Also current permissions will be probably dropped from FREE version, as they are quite difficult to setup.
